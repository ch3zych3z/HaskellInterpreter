### An implementaion of Haskell mini-language

This is a homework for functional programming course.

Author: Vyacheslav Buchin, vy.buchin@gmail.com

Features done:

- Lazy computations
- Lambda abstractions
- "If then else" expressions
- Type inference
- "Let in" expressions

### Getting started

1. Clone (`git clone https://github.com/ch3zych3z/HaskellInterpreter.git`)
2. Go to the project directory (`cd HaskellInterpreter`)
3. Build (`stack build`)
4. Run (`stack run filename`)

**NB**
The main function should look like "main = print expr"

Mutual recursion is not allowed in either top-level definitions and let-bindings
